                    Shivaji Maharaj spent his early childhood at Shivneri Fort, a place chosen by his mother, Jijabai,
                    for its safety and strong defenses. Born on February 19, 1630, Shivaji grew up under Jijabai's
                    guidance, who played a vital role in shaping his character and vision. She inspired him with stories
                    of great warriors, kings, and devotion to Swarajya (self-rule).
                    <br>
                    At Shivneri, Shivaji learned basic skills like sword fighting, horse riding, and military tactics,
                    which prepared him for future leadership. The peaceful and secure environment of the fort allowed
                    Jijabai to nurture his values of bravery, justice, and care for his people. Shivajiâ€™s time at
                    Shivneri Fort laid the foundation for his future as the founder of the Maratha Empire.
